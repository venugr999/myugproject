            <h2>Interview Questions</h2>
            <div class="question">
                <h3>1. Tell me about yourself.</h3>
                <p>I'm a recent graduate with a degree in Computer Science. During my studies, I developed a strong passion for web development and completed several projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also interned at a software company where I gained experience in Agile development and collaborated with cross-functional teams to deliver projects on time.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                <h3>2. What are your strengths?</h3>
                <p>One of my strengths is my attention to detail. I'm meticulous when it comes to coding and always strive to write clean, efficient code. Additionally, I'm a strong problem solver and enjoy tackling challenging tasks. In my previous role, I was commended for my ability to troubleshoot issues and find creative solutions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                <h3>3. What are your weaknesses?</h3>
                <p>One weakness I've identified is my tendency to get nervous during presentations. To overcome this, I've been taking public speaking courses and practicing speaking in front of small groups. I've found that with each presentation, I become more confident and comfortable addressing an audience.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">

                <h3>4. Why do you want to work for this company?</h3>
                <p>I'm impressed by the company's commitment to innovation and its collaborative work culture. I believe my skills and experience align well with the company's goals, and I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute to its success.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                <h3>5. Can you tell me about a challenge you've overcome?</h3>
                <p>One challenge I faced in a previous role was a tight deadline for a project with multiple stakeholders. I prioritized tasks, communicated effectively with team members, and worked extra hours to ensure the project was completed on time and met all requirements.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                <h3>6. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</h3>
                <p>In five years, I see myself in a leadership role within the company, leveraging my skills and experience to drive growth and innovation. I'm committed to continuous learning and development to achieve my career goals.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                <h3>7. Why should we hire you?</h3>
                <p>I bring a unique combination of technical skills, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities to the table. I'm passionate about the industry and eager to contribute to the company's success. I'm confident that my background and experience make me a valuable asset to your team.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                <h3>8. Do you have any questions for us?</h3>
                <p>Yes, I'm curious to learn more about the company's long-term goals and how this position contributes to achieving them. Additionally, I'd like to know more about the team dynamics and opportunities for professional growth within the organization.</p>
